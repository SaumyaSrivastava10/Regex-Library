'''  We define a word to be a contiguous sequence of one or more word characters that is preceded and succeeded by one or more occurrences of non-word-characters or line terminators. 
	For example, in the string I l0ve-cheese_?, the 		words are I, l0ve, and cheese_.
	We define a sub-word as follows:

	A sequence of word characters (i.e., English alphabetic letters, digits, and/or underscores) that occur in the same exact order (i.e., as a contiguous sequence) inside another word.
	It is preceded and succeeded by word characters only '''
